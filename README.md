# Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Case

This is a 3D-printable case for the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. I built it in Fusion 360. Plus, I wanted a little Raspberry logo on top—because why not?


### Features
- Designed in Fusion 360 (the .step, .stl, .obj, .fbx, and .mtl files are all here—take your pick)
- Raspberry logo cutout on the top (for style points and a bit of airflow)
- Fan mount: You can slap a small fan on top if your Pi runs hot (I use a 30mm one, but you do you)
- All ports are cut out: USB, HDMI, audiox, power, and even the camera/display slots
- Snug fit, but not so tight you’ll break your Pi getting it in
- No screws required (unless you want to mod it)

### Printing Notes
- I print it in PLA at 0.2mm layer height, but PETG or ABS should work too
- No supports needed for the main body (unless your printer hates bridges)
- The logo cutout is mostly for looks, but it does help with airflow (not really)

### Known Bugs / Quirks
- The SD card slot is a bit tight on some printers—file it down if needed
- If you use a chunky heatsink, you might need to trim the inside a bit
- The case isn’t waterproof (obviously)
- The Fusion 360 file is a bit messy—sorry, I was in a hurry


### How I Use It
I’ve got this running on my desk with a Pi 4B, a tiny fan, and a mess of wires. It’s not perfect, but it keeps the Pi cool and looks way better than the clear acrylic box I had before.

If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces. PRs welcome if you make improvements or just want to show off your print!
